# A-Story-of-Activation-Functions

Artificial Neural networks are the Anatomy of modern AI technology.
However their are several things to care about while developing such thing. Today we are talking about one of those things, i.e Activation Functions.

I have Attached a Notebook im this repo which will take you from current concepts to their ansistors. In addition their usage guides are also provide, along with their python 3 Implementation.

To check the output of a function...
```
import numpy as np    # only dependency so far...

# Code of desired function

# pass an arbitrary value
```
You can observe the different outputs of different values. point to be notted is that the output will lie between (-1, 1).
